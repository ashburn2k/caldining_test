A facility rental fee is required for use of the Clark Kerr Conference Center (buildings 12 and 14) and dining rooms (building 10) for a specified time period.  Your room rental rate includes pre-arranged room setup, breakdown, trash disposal, wireless internet connection, and complimentary water station. Food, beverage and other service charges are in addition to the rental fee.
<br /><br />
Your room is assigned according to the estimated number of people anticipated at the time of initial inquiry. Cal Catering reserves the right to change a designated room if the guest count increases or decreases. 
<br /><br />
Should an event run past the agreed upon duration, overtime charges may apply. The client is responsible for payment of all overtime charges. Room setup changes made after event confirmation may incur an additional charge.
