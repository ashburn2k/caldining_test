If you plan to serve alcoholic beverages at your event, please note the following:
<br /><br />
A “Service of Alcoholic Beverages” form (provided by your event sales coordinator) must be signed and completed prior to your event.

The client must purchase alcoholic beverages and arrange for delivery to Cal Catering (2601 Warring Street, Berkeley, CA 94720) at least 24 hours prior to the start of the event. Your event sales coordinator can assist with the ordering of wine, beer or spirits from one of our preferred partners but Cal Catering is prohibited from selling or purchasing alcohol. Cal Catering will accept and store alcoholic beverages for 24 hours prior to an event. Storage for more than 24 hours may be available for an additional fee. Any alcohol not consumed will be returned to the client at the conclusion of the event or stored for no more than 24 hours afterwards. 
<br /><br />
When alcoholic beverages are served, a non-alcoholic beverage must also be provided. Alcoholic beverages may only be consumed in the location designated for the event and the client is responsible for the conduct of all guests.

Cash bars or exchange of tickets for alcohol are not permitted, except when provided by a licensed bartender, which can be arranged for a fee.
