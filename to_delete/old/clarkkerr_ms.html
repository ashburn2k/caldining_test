                  Located  just a few blocks from the UC Berkeley campus and within driving distance from Oakland and San Francisco  International Airports,  the picturesque Spanish colonial style Clark Kerr Conference Center  is available for conferences, meetings and special functions from mid-August  through mid-May.&nbsp; </p>
                <p>Our  comfortable meeting spaces, audio-visual support, ample parking, business  center, and exceptional catering services make Clark Kerr Conference Center  the best kept secret in the Bay Area!&nbsp;</p>
                <p><a name="b" id="b"></a><strong><u>History</u></strong><br />
                  The California School  for the Deaf and Blind was founded in a small facility in San Francisco in 1860, with the State  appropriating $10,000 toward building a structure.&nbsp; 130 acres of land adjoining a tract belonging  to the College of California (later named the University  of California, Berkeley) were purchased in February 1867 for  $12,100.</p>
                <p>Under Dr.  Warring Wilkinson&rsquo;s leadership, on July 29, 1867 ground was broken for the new  school using locally quarried sandstone.&nbsp;  The entire structure was completely destroyed by fire in 1875.&nbsp; New construction began in 1877, and the  second design of the institution followed the cottage or segregated system of  detached structures in an informal English garden design.&nbsp; The plan was considered safer, more  economical and allowed for indefinite expansion.&nbsp; </p>
                <p>Respected  throughout the country as an innovative environment for the teaching of the  deaf and the blind, the school&rsquo;s success is directly attributed to the energy  and devotion of Warring Wilkinson, who served as superintendent for over four  decades until his retirement in 1909.&nbsp;  Dr. Wilkinson reported in 1909 that over 1,100 students had attended the  Institution since it opened, and fifteen had become college graduates.</p>
                <p>By 1921 a  third building plan for the site was necessitated, with the state mandate to  separate the two schools.&nbsp; This time in striking  contrast to the existing Romanesque revival buildings, a new Spanish Colonial  Revival vocabulary of architecture was developed and would continue through the  1940s.&nbsp; By the 1970s all of the original  masonry buildings were gone.&nbsp; The lovely  Mediterranean-style buildings which replaced them, and now occupy the site, are  the finest representation of the development of the Spanish Colonial Revival  tradition in California&rsquo;s  public institutions today.</p>
                <p>With  concerns of safety arising again in the late 60s and early 70s, costs of  renovating older buildings, and worries over earthquake fault lines (later  proving to be inactive), research eventually led to the schools&rsquo; move to a new  site in Fremont in 1980.</p>
                <p>In 1982 the  University acquired 50 acres of the site and began extensive renovations to  turn the complex into a new housing facility for 750 University students, with  a spacious and convenient conference center.&nbsp;  The complex is a registered city, state, and national landmark.&nbsp; </p>
                <p>The complex  was dedicated to Clark Kerr in November 1986.&nbsp;  He became Berkeley&rsquo;s  first Chancellor in 1952 having won respect for his thoughtfulness during the  Loyalty Oath controversy.&nbsp; As chancellor  he was determined to reinstate an atmosphere of freedom so damaged in the wake  of the dispute.</p>
              <p>As  University housing and conference facilities, the Clark Kerr Campus has hosted  Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the inaugural of Chancellor Robert  Berdahl.</p>
